# C++ Algorithms Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of various algorithms as per the CSU1293 course requirements. Below is a brief description of each program implemented:

1. Program to check whether a number is prime or not.
2. Program to search an element from a list using Linear Search.
3. Program to search an element from a list using Binary Search.
4. Program to sort a list of elements using Bubble Sort.
5. Program to apply insertion and searching of an item in a singly linked list.
6. Program to create a stack and apply push/pop operations.
7. Program to insert elements into a Binary Search Tree and print the tree.
8. Program to implement Depth-First Search (DFS) for a graph.
9. Program to find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
10. Program to find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskalâ€™s algorithm.

## Usage

Each program is implemented in a separate C++ source file. You can compile and run each program individually using any C++ compiler.

To compile and run a program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run.
3. Compile the source file using a C++ compiler. For example:
